# A Little Disclaimer

This blog is written by me — and also not by me.

The ideas, the opinions, the rants? 100% mine. The actual sentences on the page? I lean on AI for that part.

Why?

* I’m not a great writer.
* I’m dyslexic.
* But ironically, I still make a living reading and writing code all day.

So instead of fighting with grammar, I’d rather spend energy on the ideas. The words can get a little AI polish.

One more thing: I’ve told the AI to write like me. My tone, my sarcasm, my quirks. Think of it as me, but with fewer typos.

If that bothers you, fair warning. If not — welcome aboard.
