This is my corner of the internet where I write about technology, programming,
and the occasional tangent. There’s no set publishing schedule, and the topics
will shift depending on what I’m exploring or thinking about at the moment.
Consider it more of a digital notebook than a published magazine.
I’m not trying to chase trends or algorithms here — just sharing ideas,
experiments, and lessons learned as I go. Sometimes that means deep dives,
sometimes quick thoughts.

A small confession: I’m a bit of a terminal enthusiast. If it can be done
with a keyboard and a blinking cursor, chances are I’ll try it that way first.
And yes I’m using neovim and emacs.

If you stumble across something useful, interesting, or just mildly entertaining,
then this blog has done its job.
